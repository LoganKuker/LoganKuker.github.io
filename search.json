There has been fourteen different Dennver starting QBs since then. Only seven of those fourteen have started eight games or more and have even started a WR at QB.\nThe most important position has been an unstable shit show over the past ten years with the Broncos and fans have been fed up with it. Fans think that Bo Nix is the savior of Denver football so lets take a look at how he and all the others between stack up to one of the greatest football players of all time.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\n\nqbs &lt;- read_csv(\"qbs19752024.csv\")\n\nDenverQB &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"DEN\") |&gt; \n  filter(Season &gt; 2011) |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7)\n\nmanning_year_one &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2012\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\nmanning_year_two &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2013\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\nmanning_year_three &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2014\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\nmanning_year_four &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2015\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\nsiemian_year_one &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2016\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\nsiemian_year_two &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2017\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\nkeenum_year_one &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2018\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\nflacco_year_one &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2019\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\nlock_year_one &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2020\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\nbridgewater_year_one &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2021\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\nwilson_year_one &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2022\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\nwilson_year_two &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2023\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\nnix_year_one &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2024\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt; 7) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(TD))\n\nmanning_half &lt;- DenverQB |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Peyton Manning\") |&gt; \n  filter(Season == 2015)\n\nsiemian_two &lt;- DenverQB |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Trevor Siemian\") |&gt; \n  filter(Season == 2017)\n\nwilson_two &lt;- DenverQB |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Russell Wilson\") |&gt; \n  filter(Season == 2023)\n\nBroncos &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"Broncos\")\n\n\nrecent &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(Season &gt; 2011)\n\nBroncos &lt;- read_csv(\"Broncos.csv\")\n  \nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=DenverQB, aes(x=reorder(Player, PassingYds), weight=PassingYds),fill=\"#FB4F14\") + \n  geom_bar(data=manning_half, aes(x=reorder(Player, PassingYds), weight=PassingYds), fill=\"#002244\")+\n  geom_bar(data=siemian_two, aes(x=reorder(Player, PassingYds), weight=PassingYds), fill=\"blue\")+\n  geom_bar(data=wilson_two, aes(x=reorder(Player, PassingYds), weight=PassingYds), fill=\"blue\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Passing Yards\", \n    y=\"Player\", \n    title=\"Peyton Manning's half season was almost as productive as other's entire seasons\", \n    subtitle=\"Manning's passing yards in 2015, where he played eight games, is over half of other Broncos Qb's full seasons  \", \n    caption=\"Source: Matt Waite | By Logan Kuker\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeyton Manning is productive in football, that’s no surprise.
